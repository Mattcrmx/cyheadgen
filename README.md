# CyHeadGen

`CyHeadGen` is a project aimed at simplifying the process of converting C header files into Cython files. It includes a lexer, parser, and converter designed specifically for this purpose. The project utilizes PLY, a Python Lex-Yacc implementation, to provide robust lexical and syntactic analysis of C header files.
